## IS-115-1 23H Webprogrammering i PHP

This repo contains my solutions for assignments given in the PHP webprogramming course IS-115

`setup.sh` is a bootsrapping script that takes an assignment's PDF and automatically sets up a directory with all the files needed for each task. Since each task has it's own file, the task name will automatically be written into the file.

The purpose of this script so save time by not having to copy the template used in the previous task or assignment, onto the next. With this script, once is able to fully focus on the tasks and the learning objectives
